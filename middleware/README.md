# ðŸ”§ Middleware in Express.js

## ðŸ“Œ What is Middleware?

Middleware in **Express.js** is a function that executes **before the final route handler**.  
It can process the request, modify it, perform logic (like authentication, logging), and then pass control using `next()`.

## ðŸ“‚ Example of Middleware

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Custom middleware
const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Move to next middleware or route
};

app.use(logger); // Apply middleware globally

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Welcome to Home Page!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server started on port 3000'));
âœ… Benefits of Middleware
Reusable logic (auth, logging, validation)

Clean & maintainable code structure

Request/Response manipulation

Centralized error handling

Supports chaining for complex flows

ðŸ§  Types of Middleware
Type	Description
Application-level	Middleware bound to app via app.use()
Router-level	Middleware used with express.Router()
Built-in	e.g. express.json(), express.static()
Error-handling	Middleware with 4 args: (err, req, res, next)
Third-party	e.g. morgan, cors, helmet etc.

ðŸ”š Summary
Middleware is the core of request handling in Express.js. It helps you write modular, scalable, and cleaner code by dividing the processing of requests into separate logical steps.
